# A script that identifies whether user-input numbers are Armstrong numbers
# AO: Assignment 2 - Code Review 

#' Prompting user to enter three-digit number. This is assigned to the variable
#' userinput. 
userinput <- readline("Please enter a positive three-digit number: ")

# AO: The code is simple and it works correctly for prompting the user.

#' Checking if the user input is numeric, positive and three digits. An input 
#' number must fulfill all three conditions before progressing. The first
#' line checks if the input is a number using is.numeric. The second
#' checks if the number of characters in userinput is exactly 3. The third
#' converts userinput to a number, then checks if it is positive.  
if ((is.numeric(as.numeric(userinput))) &
    (nchar(userinput) == 3) &  
    (as.numeric(userinput) >= 0)) { 
  
# AO: The code works correctly to identify the different inputs that are possible. It is also quite simple and elegant.
# Also, try avoiding unnecessary conversions: There's no need to convert userinput to a numeric value twice. You can convert it once and store it in a variable for later use.
  # An alternative code for this steps is:
    # if (is.na(as.integer(number))) {
    # print("Error: Input is not a numeric value.")
    # quit(save = "no")
  # The code above checks if the input is numeric, and will quit if it isn't.
    # if (number < 100 | number > 999) {
    # print("Error: Input is not a three-digit number.")
    # quit(save = "no")
    #  }
  # The code above checks to see if the integers are within the appropriate range. 
  
  #' Using strsplit to split userinput into vector of individual digits. This
  #' vector is then converted to a number and assigned to the variable splitdigits. 
  splitdigits <- as.numeric(strsplit(userinput, "")[[1]])
  # Finding the sum of cubes of the individual digits in userinput
  cubesum <- sum(splitdigits^3)
  
# AO: The code above, paired with the code below, works efficiently to find an Armstrong number/ Narcissistic number.
  # An alternative is to use the %% function in order to determine the numbers. An example is shown below:
    # digits <- c(number %/% 100, (number %/% 10) %% 10, number %% 10)
    # narcissistic <- sum(digits^3)
  
  # Checking if cubesum is equal to userinput. If so, number is an Armstrong number.
  if ((as.numeric(userinput)) == (cubesum)) { 
    print(paste(userinput, "is an Armstrong number. How narcissistic of you!"))
  } else { 
    print(paste(userinput, "is not an Armstrong number. How humble you are!")) 
  } # Inner if-else to check if input is an Armstrong number
  
} else {
  print(paste(userinput, "is an invalid input! Entry must be a positive three-digit number. Terminating..."))
  quit()
} # Outer if-else checking for input validity

# AO: Again, the code is done well, and the printed line is creative! Great work. Your defensive programming is also strong as it does not allow the user to input negative number, or characters.
  # Another alternative to the code above would be (this code works alongside the code I have written earlier):
    # if (number == narcissistic) {
    # print(paste(number, "is a narcissistic number!"))
    # } else {
    # print(paste(number, "is not a narcissistic number."))
    # }

# AO: Another recommendation is to clarify variable names: 
# The variable names splitdigits and cubesum are descriptive, but it may be clearer to rename splitdigits to digits and cubesum to sumOfCubes to improve readability.
